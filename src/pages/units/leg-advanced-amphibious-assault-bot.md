description: |
  **The Telchine** is a versatile amphibious assault bot engineered for shoreline control and underwater skirmishes. Equipped with a cleansing heat ray for ground targets and a depth-charge launcher for submerged threats, it is a natural predator in coastal zones and chokepoints.

  With solid armor and strong all-terrain mobility, the Telchine excels at leading beachheads, hunting underwater units, or supporting amphibious pushes. Its adaptability makes it a valuable asset wherever land meets sea.

  **Best used for:** Shoreline control, anti-sub operations, hybrid land/sea assaults  
  **Avoid:** Prolonged duels with dedicated long-range or airborne units
