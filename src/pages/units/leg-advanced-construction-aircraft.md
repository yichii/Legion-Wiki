description: |
  **The Advanced Construction Aircraft** is a high-speed aerial builder designed to support Legion's expansion into hard-to-reach zones. With full flight mobility and a respectable build rate, it excels at setting up forward outposts, repairing airborne units, or establishing infrastructure on terrain unreachable by ground-based constructors.

  Though it lacks armor and weapons, its utility lies in mobility â€” use it to rush radar coverage, early warning systems, or backup energy grids in remote locations. Its fragile frame makes it vulnerable to even light AA fire, so always scout ahead or pair it with escorts when operating near contested airspace.

  **Best used for:** Expanding into remote terrain, assisting aircraft repairs, establishing air-focused bases  
  **Avoid:** Leaving idle in AA zones, deploying near active skirmishes, relying on it for ground defense
