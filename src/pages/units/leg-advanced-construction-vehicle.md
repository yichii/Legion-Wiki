description: |
  **The Advanced Construction Vehicle** is Legion’s premier Tier 2 engineering unit, bringing exceptional build speed and expanded structure access to any battlefield. Heavily upgraded from its T1 counterpart, it enables the construction of advanced economy, defenses, and experimental units — serving as the backbone of late-game infrastructure.

  Though still lightly armored and unarmed, its mobility allows it to quickly reinforce frontlines or reclaim wreckage for rapid resource injection. Smart commanders keep them shielded and pair them with escort units to ensure they can operate safely in contested zones.

  **Best used for:** Rapid Tier 2 expansion, base fortification, reclaiming battlefields  
  **Avoid:** Combat zones without protection — it’s too valuable to risk
