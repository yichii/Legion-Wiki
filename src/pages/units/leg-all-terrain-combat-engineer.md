description: |
  **The Proteus** is a fast and versatile combat engineer designed to traverse harsh terrain and support Legion forces wherever they fight. With excellent speed and all-terrain mobility, it can build and assist in locations unreachable by conventional constructors.

  Though lightly armored and unarmed, its value lies in its flexibilityâ€”whether repairing units on the frontline, expanding forward bases, or establishing radar and energy outposts on cliffs and ridges.

  **Best used for:** Cliffside expansion, frontline repairs, mobile construction in rough terrain  
  **Avoid:** Combat zones without escort, direct exposure to enemy fire
