description: |
  **The Toxotai** is a mobile amphibious anti-air bot armed with a high-range salvo missile launcher. Capable of defending both land and water units, it’s crucial for fending off early air raids, gunships, and bombers during tech transitions or expansion phases.

  While not effective against ground targets, the Toxotai’s strong AA coverage and amphibious mobility make it an auto-include in any mixed Legion force. Be sure to include at least one in every army group to avoid surprise air losses.

  **Best used for:** Anti-air screens, defending naval or land armies, escorting constructors  
  **Avoid:** Ground combat — this unit cannot attack ground targets
