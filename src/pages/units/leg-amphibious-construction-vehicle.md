description: |
  **The Otter** is an amphibious construction vehicle that enables Legion to expand and build across both land and shallow water. Its flexibility makes it essential on hybrid maps, allowing you to secure metal spots, build naval facilities, and create defensive structures on coastlines.

  Though slower to produce and lightly armored, its ability to traverse diverse terrain gives it a significant strategic edge — particularly in early naval tech paths or water-dominated battles.

  **Best used for:** Hybrid map expansion, shoreline base building, naval starts  
  **Avoid:** Combat zones, aggressive frontlines — keep it safe and building
