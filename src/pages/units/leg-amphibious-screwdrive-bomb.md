description: |
  **The Snapper** is a high-speed amphibious suicide unit designed to slip through enemy lines and detonate directly on priority targets. With its screwdrive propulsion system, it navigates land and water with ease, making it a flexible and terrifying threat from multiple fronts.

  Though fragile and unarmed in the traditional sense, the Snapper delivers a devastating self-destruction blast capable of crippling clusters of units or obliterating static defenses. Best used in swarms or flanking maneuvers to punch holes in fortified positions.

  **Best used for:** Ambushing static defenses, cracking fortified lines, destroying high-value targets  
  **Avoid:** Being intercepted by fast units or prematurely detonated by area-of-effect fire
