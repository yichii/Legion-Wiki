description: |
  **The Alpheus** is Legion’s primary anti-air hovercraft, designed to eliminate low- to mid-tier aerial threats with rapid-response firepower. Equipped with a high-speed ground-to-air gatling gun, it tears through scouts, bombers, and gunships that stray too close to your hover formations or coastal bases.

  Its mobility over land and shallow water makes it ideal for escorting hover and amphibious units in mixed terrain. While it offers no ground attack capabilities, its high DPS and fast speed allow it to intercept enemy air incursions and reposition quickly to defend high-value targets.

  **Best used for:** Escorting hover forces, defending against T1 air spam, patrolling amphibious zones  
  **Avoid:** Engaging ground targets — it has no anti-ground capability
