  **The Charon** is a rugged anti-air truck built to shred enemy aircraft with a stream of high-velocity minigun fire. Its extended air detection range and focused firepower make it a crucial escort for convoys and mobile armies vulnerable to air raids.

  While it lacks the durability and versatility of dedicated front-line units, the Charon’s high rate of fire and decent mobility allow it to reposition quickly and deny airspace effectively — as long as it’s not left isolated.

  **Best used for:** Defending pushes from air attacks, escorting valuable units  
  **Avoid:** Engaging ground forces or leading the charge — it’s not built for it
