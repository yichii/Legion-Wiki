  **The Decurion** is a durable frontline assault tank designed to punch through enemy lines with sustained firepower. Armed with a rapid-fire machine gun, it excels at mowing down light targets and holding ground under pressure.

  In early skirmishes, the Decurion can spearhead attacks or soak up fire while lighter Legion units deal damage from behind. Its high health pool makes it ideal for drawing turret fire and surviving longer in drawn-out engagements.

  **Best deployed with:** Hoplites, mobile AA  
  **Avoid:** Overextending, long-range skirmishers
