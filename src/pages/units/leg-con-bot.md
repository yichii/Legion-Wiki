description: "The Construction Bot can build basic Tech 1 structures and is the cheapest construction unit. Use multiple on a single structure to increase build power. It's quite slow and weak, so try to escort it with a few Grunts when expanding. Each constructor also increases the player's energy and metal storage capacity by 50. Mobile constructors produce a small amount of energy, helping you scale economy just by having them alive. Construction Turrets do not do this."
