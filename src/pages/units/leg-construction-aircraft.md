  **The Legion Construction Aircraft** is a lightweight flying builder designed for rapid expansion and flexible base layouts. While fragile and completely unarmed, it compensates with high speed and full aerial mobility, allowing it to reach remote or contested build zones quickly.

  Perfect for early radar towers, forward factories, or sneaky proxy bases, this aircraft enables Legion to maintain map control and establish infrastructure where ground units would struggle to reach. Keep it protected â€” even basic anti-air can bring it down quickly.

  **Best used for:** Fast expansions, island bases, forward radar and turrets  
  **Avoid:** Anti-air fire, frontline zones, idle hovering in open skies
