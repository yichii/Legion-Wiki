description: |
  **The Construction Vehicle** is a core Legion engineering unit, essential for base-building, expansion, and infrastructure development. With the ability to construct factories, defenses, and economy structures, it forms the backbone of any ground-based operation.

  Although unarmed, it boasts substantial durability for a T1 builder, allowing it to survive light skirmishes or escape failed proxy builds. Keep it protected, and it will enable your tech path, energy economy, and map control.

  **Best used for:** Expanding territory, building factories and eco  
  **Avoid:** Combat zones — it’s tough, but defenseless
