description: |
  The Decoy Commander is a fake replica of your actual Legion Commander. It can build basic Tech 1 structures, including landmines, and provides supplemental build power at the front.

  Use it to confuse and bait your opponent into revealing their forces or wasting firepower on the wrong target. While not as powerful as a true commander, it serves as a valuable psychological and tactical tool.
