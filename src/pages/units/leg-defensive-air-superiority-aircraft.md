description: |
  **The Ajax** is a dedicated air superiority aircraft built to dominate aerial engagements and shield Legion forces from enemy air threats. Outfitted with twin heavy gatling guns and enhanced air detection, it shreds opposing bombers, gunships, and scouts before they get close.

  Its role is simple but vital: patrol the skies, intercept aerial incursions, and maintain air dominance over key areas. While not designed for ground attack, the Ajax’s sheer aerial DPS and extended vision make it one of the most efficient dogfighters in Legion’s arsenal.

  **Best used for:** Patrolling skies, intercepting bombers, air defense screens  
  **Avoid:** Ground fire, attacking buildings or units outside of its anti-air specialty
