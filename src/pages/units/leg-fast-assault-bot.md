description: |
  **The Phobos** is a lightning-fast assault bot designed to overwhelm enemies with speed and brutal close-range firepower. Armed with a high-damage gauss cannon and boasting top-tier mobility, it excels at ambushing fragile targets, chasing down retreating units, and diving into exposed backlines.

  While it canâ€™t withstand prolonged engagements or heavy turret fire, its hit-and-run potential is unmatched at the T1 stage. Use Phobos squads to fracture enemy formations, disrupt artillery lines, or pounce on overextended constructors.

  **Best used for:** Ambushing soft targets, diving rearlines, flanking static defenses  
  **Avoid:** Getting bogged down in sustained fights or caught in AoE fire
