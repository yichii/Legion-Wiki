description: |
  **The Alaris** is a lightning-fast assault tank built for early-game harassment and flanking. Armed with a short-range Gauss cannon, it excels at quickly closing the distance and hitting soft targets before retreating.

  Its low health and limited range make it poorly suited for direct engagements, but its speed allows it to bypass enemy lines, chase down raiders, or snipe unprotected constructors and energy infrastructure.

  **Best used for:** Harassment, map control, constructor hunting  
  **Avoid:** Prolonged fights, defenses, high-DPS frontline units
