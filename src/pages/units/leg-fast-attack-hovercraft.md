description: |
  **The Glaucus** is a lightweight fast-attack hovercraft built for rapid strikes and flank harassment. Boasting impressive speed and surface agility, it excels at chasing down slow units, harassing undefended expansion points, and dodging return fire across land and sea.

  Armed with a short-range heat ray, the Glaucus melts through light targets with ease but struggles against armored units or defensive structures. It's best used in packs to overwhelm isolated foes before retreating to safety. Its hover capability allows it to traverse shallow water and outmaneuver terrain-dependent ground units.

  **Best used for:** Hit-and-run raids, expansion harassment, chasing retreating units  
  **Avoid:** Engaging heavy armor or clumping into static defenses
