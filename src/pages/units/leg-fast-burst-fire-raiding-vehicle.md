description: |
  **The Quickshot** is a high-speed burst-fire raiding vehicle designed for aggressive flanking and harassment. Armed with twin plasma cannons that fire in rapid bursts, it can quickly deal significant damage before darting out of range, making it ideal for hit-and-run tactics.

  With excellent mobility and decent vision, the Quickshot excels at scouting, chasing down retreating units, and disrupting isolated targets. However, its light armor and short range make it vulnerable if it overcommits or gets caught in prolonged engagements.

  **Best used for:** Ambushes, skirmishing, flanking soft targets  
  **Avoid:** Head-on duels, static defenses, concentrated fire
