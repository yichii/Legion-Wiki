description: |
  **The Hoplite** is a nimble raider bot engineered for speed and suppression. Outfitted with twin rapid-fire machine guns, it excels at harassing exposed units, pressuring undefended expansions, and catching slower targets off guard.

  Its agility makes it ideal for hit-and-run attacks, scouting enemy movements, or disrupting resource operations. While not built for prolonged combat, the Hoplite thrives on momentum and timing.

  **Best used for:** Fast raids, harassing constructors, chasing down retreating units  
  **Avoid:** Facing heavy armor, turrets, or AoE firepower head-on
