description: |
  **The Noctua** is a fast and deadly fighter drone built for air superiority. Armed with a burst-fire air-to-air machine gun, it excels at intercepting enemy gunships, bombers, and other aircraft before they can threaten Legion infrastructure or armies.

  With exceptional speed and powerful aerial DPS, the Noctua can dominate early skies when deployed in swarms. However, it is lightly armored and vulnerable to ground-based AA or even concentrated enemy fighters if not micro-managed well.

  **Best used for:** Intercepting air units, denying enemy bombing runs, controlling skies  
  **Avoid:** Ground fire, overcommitting without numbers, engaging gunships without support
