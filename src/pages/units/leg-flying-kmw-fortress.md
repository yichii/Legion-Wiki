description: |
  **The Tyrannus** is Legion’s airborne behemoth — a flying fortress bristling with kinetic weaponry capable of suppressing both air and ground threats. Armed with a mix of burst-fire machine guns, dual plasma cannons, and advanced AA missiles, it acts as a mobile base-cracker and no-fly-zone in one.

  While relatively slow and costly, its immense durability and broad weapon coverage make it a nightmare to deal with unprepared. Use it to spearhead aerial assaults, escort high-value bombers, or establish air dominance over contested zones.

  **Best used for:** Airborne sieges, heavy escort duty, securing large airspace  
  **Avoid:** Overextension without support, massed ground AA, swarm fighters
