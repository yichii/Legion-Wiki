description: |
  **The Aquilon** is a specialized heavy anti-air bot engineered for amphibious warfare. Outfitted with dual weapon systems—a rapid-fire gatling gun and a precise railgun—it can efficiently shred enemy aircraft in both land and water operations.

  With excellent anti-air DPS and amphibious mobility, the Aquilon secures shorelines, escorts beachheads, and defends advancing forces against aerial harassment. However, its focus on air targets makes it vulnerable to ground threats without proper screening.

  **Best used for:** Clearing skies over land and water, escorting naval landings, anti-air coverage in contested zones  
  **Avoid:** Engaging ground units directly or straying too far from allied support
