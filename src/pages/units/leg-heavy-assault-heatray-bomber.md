description: |
  **The Phoenix** is a high-speed heavy bomber equipped with a devastating flame-based heat ray, designed to incinerate enemy forces and structures in wide strafing runs. Its massive DPS and long range allow it to melt defenses and fortifications in seconds â€” if it survives the approach.

  Built for surgical strikes, the Phoenix excels at breaching entrenched positions or erasing exposed armies. But with light armor and no anti-air capability, it relies heavily on support units and precise timing to be effective. Strike hard, strike fast, then retreat.

  **Best used for:** Breaking defenses, frontline meltdowns, hit-and-run bombing runs  
  **Avoid:** Flying through AA nests, lingering after passes, unsupported deep strikes
