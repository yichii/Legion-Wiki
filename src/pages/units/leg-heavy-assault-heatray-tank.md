description: |
  **The Prometheus** is a frontline juggernaut designed to break through enemy lines with overwhelming close-range firepower. Armed with a devastating cleansing heat ray and reinforced with heavy armor, it thrives in brutal brawls and base assaults.

  Its high damage output and durability make it perfect for leading charges, drawing fire, and melting clustered defenses. While it's vulnerable to kiting or air strikes, few ground units can stand toe-to-toe with it in a slugfest.

  **Best used for:** Frontline pushes, base-breaking, absorbing damage  
  **Avoid:** Long-range duels, air swarms, or open flanks without support
