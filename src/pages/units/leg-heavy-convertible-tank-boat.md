description: |
  **The Triton** is a heavy, amphibious assault unit capable of seamlessly transitioning between land and sea combat. Armed with a powerful gauss cannon and thick armor plating, it excels at spearheading assaults across coastal lines and river crossings.

  Its unique mobility allows it to pressure enemy defenses in places where traditional tanks or ships fall short — whether rolling across beaches or surfacing in unexpected naval zones. Though not the fastest, its versatility and staying power make it a frontline juggernaut.

  **Best used for:** Amphibious assaults, holding beachheads, hybrid land/sea pushes  
  **Avoid:** Swarms of air units or being left without support — it's strong, not invincible
