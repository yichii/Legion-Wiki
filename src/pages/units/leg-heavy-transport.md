description: |
  **The Hippotes** is a durable heavy transport aircraft designed to carry Legion units across otherwise impassable terrain. With a reinforced frame and significant cargo capacity, it’s ideal for setting up proxy attacks, evacuating factories, or inserting forces behind enemy lines.

  While unarmed and slower than most aircraft, its high health allows it to survive light AA fire — but only briefly. Use the Hippotes to deliver bots or vehicles over water, cliffs, or choke points, enabling strategic flexibility far beyond walking range.

  **Best used for:** Airlifting bots/vehicles, proxy base setups, tactical redeployment  
  **Avoid:** Flying through enemy AA nets, leaving it idle post-drop
