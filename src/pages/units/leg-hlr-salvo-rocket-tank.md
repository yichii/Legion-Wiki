description: |
  **The Medusa** is a heavy rocket artillery tank built for overwhelming firepower and saturation bombardment. Firing a deadly volley of hexaburst homing rockets, it blankets enemy positions with sustained explosive force, making it ideal for softening up entrenched defenses before an assault.

  While not stealthy like the Boreas, the Medusa trades subtlety for raw area denial. Its salvos can break formations, punish static build-ups, and force enemies to relocate. However, it requires vision support and protection due to its slow speed and lack of close-range defenses.

  **Best used for:** Siege support, zone suppression, overwhelming static defenses  
  **Avoid:** Isolation, fast flankers, or pushing without a screen of frontline units
