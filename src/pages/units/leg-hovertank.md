description: |
  **The Nereus** is Legion’s standard hover tank, delivering balanced offensive and defensive capabilities for controlling amphibious terrain. Armed with a medium plasma cannon and moderate armor, it forms the backbone of hover-based assaults and defenses.

  While not as fast as lighter skirmishers, the Nereus trades speed for staying power, able to absorb hits and return fire effectively in small-scale engagements. Its hover chassis allows it to support naval raids, pressure coastal bases, and reinforce across shallow water where land units can’t follow.

  **Best used for:** Mainline hover assaults, amphibious zone control, durable frontline anchor  
  **Avoid:** Charging heavy turrets or massed artillery without support
