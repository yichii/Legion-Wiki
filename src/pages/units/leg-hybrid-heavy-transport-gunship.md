description: |
  **The Stronghold** is a durable hybrid aircraft that combines heavy firepower with utility transport capabilities. Armed with a close-range aerial shotgun and built with thick armor, it serves as both a frontline skirmisher and a tactical troop carrier.

  While not as fast as dedicated gunships, its ability to carry units into battle zones makes it ideal for coordinated strikes, surprise flanks, or rapid reinforcements. Its versatility shines when paired with fast assault bots or engineers for high-risk, high-reward insertions behind enemy lines.

  **Best used for:** Frontline brawls, surprise drops, armored air support  
  **Avoid:** Long-range AA zones, unsupported insertions, relying on it for air dominance
