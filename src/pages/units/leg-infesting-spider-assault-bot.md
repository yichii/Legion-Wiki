description: |
  **The Infestor** is a hybrid assault and support spider-bot, equally capable of spreading chaos on the battlefield and assisting allied operations. Armed with a short-range heat ray, it excels in close-quarters ambushes, while its mobility allows it to traverse difficult terrain with ease.

  But what makes the Infestor unique is its ability to assist, repair, and reclaim, making it a frontline utility tool for aggressive expansion and battlefield recovery. Use it to harass enemy constructors, clean up wrecks, and patch up your forward forces mid-push.

  **Best used for:** Ambush support, reclaiming on the move, reinforcing assault forces  
  **Avoid:** Engaging alone in ranged fights or exposing it to heavy burst damage
