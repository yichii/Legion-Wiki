description: |
  **The Blindfold** is a high-speed tactical bomber drone that specializes in electronic warfare. Instead of dealing damage directly, it disables or destroys enemy radar systems, mines, and stealth jammers using magnetic impulse bombs — clearing the way for conventional forces to strike.

  With high speed and a surprisingly tanky frame for a drone, the Blindfold is perfect for softening up enemy bases before a push, especially against stealth-heavy factions or mine-laden terrain. However, its bombs have no effect on traditional units, making it a pure utility craft.

  **Best used for:** Neutralizing radar, clearing mines, disabling stealth before attacks  
  **Avoid:** Using it as a damage dealer — this is not a combat bomber
