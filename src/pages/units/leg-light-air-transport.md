description: |
  **The Aeolus** is a fast and lightweight transport aircraft built for rapid deployment of individual bots or small units. Its low cost and high speed make it ideal for sneaky proxy base drops, grabbing distant metal spots, or quickly repositioning builders and scouts.

  With limited durability and no armaments, it’s best used surgically — in and out before the enemy can react. Don’t rely on it in high-AA environments, but in open or poorly defended zones, it opens up serious tactical possibilities.

  **Best used for:** Fast engineer drops, light assault insertions, reclaim runs  
  **Avoid:** Areas with anti-air, long idle flight paths
