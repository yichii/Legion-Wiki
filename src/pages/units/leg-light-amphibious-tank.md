description: |
  **The Cetus** is a light amphibious tank capable of engaging enemies on both land and water. Equipped with a mid-powered Gauss cannon and high sight range, it excels at forward scouting, shoreline skirmishes, and harassment across varied terrain.

  While not heavily armored, its balanced stats and amphibious capability make it a flexible unit for mixed-map control. Use it to pressure water expansions, flank coastal defenses, or screen for heavier ground units.

  **Best used for:** Shoreline raids, amphibious pushes, flexible map control  
  **Avoid:** Overextending into high-DPS or massed enemy forces
