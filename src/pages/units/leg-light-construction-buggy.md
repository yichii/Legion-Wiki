description: |
  **The Aceso** is a nimble construction buggy designed to bring swift support and flexibility to the battlefield. Though lightly armored, its high speed and generous build power make it ideal for fast expansion, front-line repairs, and reclaim operations.

  With its ability to rapidly establish outposts or reinforce damaged units under fire, the Aceso is a cornerstone of Legion’s mobile logistics — especially when paired with heavier units to shield it.

  **Best used for:** Rapid expansion, reclaiming wrecks, front-line assistance  
  **Avoid:** Direct combat — keep it moving and protected
