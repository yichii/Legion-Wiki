description: |
  **The Mosquito** is a swift and agile light gunship built for harassment and anti-light duties. Armed with short-range rockets, it excels at striking exposed constructors, fleeing skirmishers, or clustered enemy scouts — especially where ground units can’t reach.

  With moderate durability and flexible speed, the Mosquito can kite slower units and pressure expansions with ease. However, it is vulnerable to AA fire and should not be used in frontal assaults. Think of it as a flying scalpel: dangerous in open skies, fragile in dense AA fields.

  **Best used for:** Early harassment, chasing down light targets, map presence  
  **Avoid:** Engaging anti-air, attacking hardened frontlines without support
