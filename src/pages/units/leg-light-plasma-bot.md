  **The Satyr** is a dependable light plasma bot that excels in large numbers. With solid range and a forward-firing plasma cannon, it forms the backbone of Legion’s early ground forces, capable of trading well against most T1 threats.

  While not specialized in any one area, the Satyr’s low cost, decent health, and scalable damage output make it ideal for area control, reinforcement waves, and attrition-based skirmishes. Leave no battlefield without a few Satyrs in the mix.

  **Best used for:** Main battle line, early swarm tactics, pushing unsupported flanks  
  **Avoid:** AoE damage, bottlenecks, fighting without numbers
