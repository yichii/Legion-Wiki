description: |
  **The Wheelie** is a lightning-fast recon vehicle built for early map control and intelligence gathering. With unmatched speed and a powerful sensor suite, it can quickly scout expansions, identify enemy positions, and bait units into ambushes.

  While lightly armed with a burst machine gun, its true value lies in its speed and sight range. Use it to disrupt early expansions, force overreactions, or screen for heavier Legion forces — just don't expect it to survive a direct encounter.

  **Best used for:** Scouting, harassment, vision control  
  **Avoid:** Any kind of sustained combat — it dies to everything
