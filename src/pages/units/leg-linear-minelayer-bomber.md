description: |
  **The Harbinger** is a specialized minelayer bomber that deploys explosive payloads in a straight line, turning entire corridors or choke points into deadly no-go zones. Designed to disrupt enemy advances and trap mobile forces, it excels at area control and passive zone denial.

  Though unarmed in the traditional sense, its bombing run leaves a trail of mines that punish any enemy careless enough to chase or maneuver through its flight path. Best used on tight maps or in defensive preparations, the Harbinger can quietly shift the flow of battle with proper placement and timing.

  **Best used for:** Laying traps, blocking paths, slowing enemy momentum  
  **Avoid:** Anti-air fields, aggressive engagements, misuse without intel
