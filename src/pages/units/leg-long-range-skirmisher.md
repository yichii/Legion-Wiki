description: |
  **The Lance** is a long-range skirmisher armed with a precision railgun, designed to chip away at enemies from a safe distance. With excellent vision and a reach that exceeds most T1 units, the Lance excels at softening up enemy forces before they can retaliate.

  Though its DPS is modest and it lacks burst potential, it thrives when protected by frontliners or used from high ground. Use it to zone choke points, outrange enemy static defenses, or punish slow-moving assaults.

  **Best used for:** Long-range poke, fire support, safe pressure  
  **Avoid:** Close-range combat, being left unsupported
