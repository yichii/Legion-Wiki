description: |
  **The Inferno** is a long-range burst-fire artillery vehicle that rains fiery devastation across wide areas of the battlefield. Armed with triple napalm cannons, it blankets zones in lingering flames, disrupting enemy formations and softening defenses from afar.

  Its fire-based payload excels at area denial, making it ideal for locking down chokepoints, disrupting build operations, or flushing enemies out of cover. Though fragile up close and slow to reposition, it becomes a nightmare when left unchecked in the rear line.

  **Best used for:** Area denial, softening entrenched positions, supporting sieges  
  **Avoid:** Close-quarters ambushes or front-line exposure â€” keep it shielded and stationary
