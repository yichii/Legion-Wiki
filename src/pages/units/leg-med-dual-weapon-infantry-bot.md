description: |
  **The Karkinos** is a brutal mid-tier assault bot armed with both a focused heat ray and a wide-angle shotgun, making it devastating in close-range brawls. Its high health pool and exceptional DPS allow it to anchor frontal pushes or crack defensive positions.

  Designed to punish overextended units or break through light fortifications, the Karkinos thrives when paired with support fire or swarm distractions. Its only weakness is its slower speed â€” get it into the fight, and it will handle the rest.

  **Best used for:** Close-quarters brawling, assaulting positions, tank cracking  
  **Avoid:** Being kited, long-range fights, open retreats
