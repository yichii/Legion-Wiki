description: |
  **The Ballista** is a medium-range rocket bot built for sustained damage and fire support. With solid health and excellent range, it’s ideal for wearing down enemy frontlines or punishing static defenses from safety.

  Though slow and vulnerable if caught alone, Ballistas shine when positioned behind tanks or choke points. Their ranged pressure forces enemy movement and enables Legion to take favorable engagements.

  **Best used for:** Mid-line pressure, support fire, ranged standoffs  
  **Avoid:** Being flanked or rushed — always keep them covered
