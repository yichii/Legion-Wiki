description: |
  **The Gladiator** is a mid-weight skirmisher tank equipped with a burst-fire plasma cannon, delivering quick volleys of damage before repositioning. With a solid mix of range, firepower, and mobility, it thrives in hit-and-run tactics and prolonged trades.

  Its burst nature allows it to punish exposed units before slipping out of retaliation range, especially when microed well. Though not the toughest on the field, a line of Gladiators can steadily erode enemy forces while staying just out of reach.

  **Best used for:** Mid-range engagements, flanking formations, sustained pressure  
  **Avoid:** Soaking frontline damage â€” pair with tanks for protection
