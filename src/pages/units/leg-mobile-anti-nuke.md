description: |
  **The Savior** is a highly specialized mobile platform designed to intercept and neutralize intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs). With its long-range anti-nuke launcher, it offers critical last-line defense against devastating enemy superweapons.

  Though lightly armored and not meant for frontline duty, the Savior can be repositioned to cover high-value targets or newly established forward bases. Its presence alone can force opponents to reconsider their strategic missile usage.

  **Best used for:** Denying ICBM strikes, protecting key infrastructure, supplementing static anti-nuke coverage  
  **Avoid:** All direct combat â€” this unit exists solely to stop nukes
