description: |
  **The Cleaver** is a mobile cluster artillery vehicle built to saturate enemy positions with explosive fragment shells. Unlike traditional precision artillery, the Cleaver prioritizes wide-area suppression over accuracyâ€”its salvos deal heavy area damage, making it ideal for breaking up entrenched formations or swarms.

  Though lightly armored and vulnerable when caught alone, its long range and splash potential make it an effective support piece when used behind frontlines. Terrain-aware commanders can exploit its mobility to reposition frequently and avoid counter-battery fire.

  **Best used for:** Area denial, softening clustered enemies, supporting frontal pushes  
  **Avoid:** Direct confrontation, fast raiders, or air strikes
