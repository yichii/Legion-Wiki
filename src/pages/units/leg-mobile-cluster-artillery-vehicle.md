  **The Arquebus** is a long-range, all-terrain heavy weapon platform designed to pierce enemy armor with pinpoint railgun shots. With excellent range and high alpha damage, it excels at sniping key targets before they can respond, especially in rugged terrain where conventional vehicles struggle.

  Its tracked legs and stable firing platform let it maneuver across hills and cliffs while maintaining accuracy. However, its low fire rate and moderate durability mean it must be protectedâ€”think of it as mobile artillery with surgical intent.

  **Best used for:** Long-range fire support, punishing slow or exposed targets, terrain abuse  
  **Avoid:** Close-range brawls, leading charges, or unsupported deployment
