  **The Mantis** is a mobile drone carrier designed to project firepower from a safe distance. Once deployed, it launches a swarm of lightweight autonomous drones that harass enemy forces and pressure frontlines without exposing the Mantis itself.

  Though fragile and lacking direct weapons, the Mantis excels when used behind allied lines or in ambush setups where its drones can operate freely. Strategic positioning and timing are key — protect it, and it will multiply your field presence significantly.

  **Best used for:** Long-range harassment, augmenting front-line DPS from safety  
  **Avoid:** Direct confrontation — it’s the drones that do the fighting, not the carrier
