description: |
  **The Incinerator** is a slow-moving weapon platform built around one core philosophy: obliteration through fire. Equipped with a sustained heavy heat ray, it melts through even the most fortified ground targets with brutal efficiency. 

  Despite its overwhelming firepower and solid durability, the Incinerator crawls across the battlefield at a glacial pace, making it easy to kite, flank, or disable if not properly escorted. It excels when deployed behind a frontline or sieging hardened positions with supporting forces.

  **Best used for:** Breaking entrenched defenses, melting high-HP targets, area denial  
  **Avoid:** Operating without protection, chasing mobile enemies, overextending into open terrain
