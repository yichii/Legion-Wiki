description: |
  **The Barrage** is a fire-based artillery unit that launches slow but devastating napalm shells, designed to control space and wear down enemy forces over time. While its direct damage is low, the lingering fire effect can zone out choke points, force unit displacement, and punish static defenses.

  With a high health pool for an artillery piece, the Barrage can withstand light fire while supporting frontal pushes â€” but it requires protection and positioning to truly shine.

  **Best used for:** Area denial, choke control, supporting frontal assaults  
  **Avoid:** Direct engagements, mobile skirmishers, fast raiders
