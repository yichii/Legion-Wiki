description: |
  **The Belchar** is a fire-slinging skirmish bot engineered to control space and pressure formations with incendiary area denial. Equipped with a napalm cannon, it excels at flushing enemies from cover, disrupting light squads, and creating lasting fire zones that punish poor positioning.

  Though slower-firing and not suited for direct duels, its persistent burn damage makes it a powerful support unit when paired with frontline tanks or riot bots. The Belchar thrives when used to choke off retreat paths or saturate choke points with flame.

  **Best used for:** Zoning, crowd control, punishing clustered or static enemies  
  **Avoid:** Fighting alone, dueling heavy units, or chasing fast-moving targets
