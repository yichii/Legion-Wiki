description: |
  **The Augur** is a lightweight radar reconnaissance bot built for wide-area battlefield awareness. Outfitted with long-range sensors and high mobility, it serves as the Legion's early warning system â€” detecting enemy movement long before visual contact is made.

  Though unarmed and fragile, the Augur excels when deployed behind your frontlines or at key terrain chokepoints. Use it to establish radar coverage, scout enemy staging areas, and maintain strategic oversight during engagements.

  **Best used for:** Early detection, expanding radar coverage, passive scouting  
  **Avoid:** Direct combat, front-line exposure, or isolation near enemy skirmishers
