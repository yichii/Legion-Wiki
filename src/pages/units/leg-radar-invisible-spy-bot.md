description: |
  **The Spectre** is a cutting-edge infiltration bot built for deep reconnaissance and strategic surveillance. Unlike traditional scouts, it is completely invisible to radar and sonar, detectable only by proximity or specialized counter-intrusion systems.

  This makes the Spectre ideal for slipping behind enemy lines to provide long-range artillery with constant vision of high-value targets. Though it technically has build power, it cannot construct or repair â€” it can only reclaim wreckage when safe to do so.

  **Best used for:** Revealing fortified positions, shadowing enemy movements, spotting for artillery without detection  
  **Avoid:** Getting too close to enemies or entering areas with counter-intrusion defenses
