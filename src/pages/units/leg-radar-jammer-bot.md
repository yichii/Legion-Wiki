description: |
  **The Deceiver** is a lightweight radar jammer bot designed to conceal your forces from enemy detection. Emitting a cloaking field that scrambles radar signatures, it’s the perfect companion for ambush squads, stealth attacks, or flanking maneuvers under the fog of war.

  While completely unarmed and lightly armored, the Deceiver’s true power lies in information denial. Pair it with assault units to mask their approach, or use it to protect your forward outposts from radar-based targeting systems.

  **Best used for:** Concealing armies, protecting flanks, supporting stealth-based pushes  
  **Avoid:** Frontline exposure, AoE damage, operating solo without units to shield
