description: |
  **The Cicero** is a stealth-support vehicle that projects a powerful radar jamming field, concealing friendly units from enemy detection systems. While it cannot cloak allies directly, its wide jammer range ensures that your forces remain hidden from radar — perfect for surprise attacks, stealthy retreats, or masking army movements.

  Like most support units, the Cicero is unarmed and lightly armored, making it a poor front-line candidate. Instead, park it just behind your advancing forces or near vulnerable forward positions to deny radar coverage to the enemy.

  **Best used for:** Concealing troop movements, disrupting enemy intel, aiding ambushes  
  **Avoid:** Combat exposure or leaving it idle — reposition it actively with your army
