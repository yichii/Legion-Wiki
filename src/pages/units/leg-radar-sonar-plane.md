description: |
  **The Whisper** is a high-speed aerial reconnaissance plane equipped with long-range radar and sonar arrays. Designed to silently sweep both land and sea for enemy presence, it provides vital intel on unit movement, hidden threats, and naval activity — all from a safe distance.

  With unmatched speed and impressive detection range, the Whisper is ideal for maintaining map control and enabling long-range units like artillery and missile launchers. While completely unarmed and lightly armored, its stealthy, high-altitude flight profile helps keep it out of danger — just avoid enemy anti-air and fighters.

  **Best used for:** Scouting enemy territory, radar/sonar coverage, intel support for long-range units  
  **Avoid:** AA zones, direct contact with enemy air units, hovering too long over hostile areas
