  **The Pheme** is a lightweight radar vehicle designed to extend Legion's battlefield awareness with long-range detection capabilities. While it lacks direct combat abilities, its superior radar and vision range make it essential for tracking enemy movements and planning engagements.

  Fragile and unarmed, the Pheme should stay behind the frontlines or in safe flanking positions, feeding critical intelligence to your army. Its mobility allows for repositioning when the front shifts — just don’t let it wander into danger.

  **Best used for:** Scouting, early warning, battlefield control  
  **Avoid:** Frontline exposure or isolation — it can’t fight back
