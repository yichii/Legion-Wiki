description: |
  **The Venator** is Legion’s fastest air unit — a rapid-response flak interceptor designed to eliminate enemy aircraft before they become a threat. Armed with a high-velocity birdshot cannon and boasting unmatched speed, it excels at hit-and-run tactics and chasing down slower bombers or gunships.

  Its flak-style weaponry gives it a strong edge in dogfights, especially against lightly armored air targets. However, its paper-thin armor and lack of ground attack capabilities make it a glass cannon — devastating when microed, vulnerable when left idle.

  **Best used for:** Air swarms, bomber interceptions, quick air patrols  
  **Avoid:** Static anti-air zones, prolonged exposure, engaging heavy gunships solo
