  **The Salacia** is Legion’s Tier 1 hover rocket launcher, providing long-range fire support from behind the front lines. Its guided rockets allow it to soften up enemy positions, punish exposed units, and harass static defenses — all while keeping a safe distance.

  Though its health is modest and it lacks close-range defenses, the Salacia excels when positioned behind tanks, bots, or terrain cover. Its hover mobility enables it to reposition across water and land, making it ideal for island harassment and flanking from unexpected angles.

  **Best used for:** Long-range support, poke and retreat tactics, amphibious harassment  
  **Avoid:** Frontline combat or exposure without screening units
