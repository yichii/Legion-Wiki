description: |
  **The Thanatos** is a tier-2 rocket bot specializing in long-range area suppression. Fitted with a high-arc Catapult Rocket system, it delivers salvos that saturate enemy positions from a safe distance, making it ideal for breaking entrenched defenses or softening up vehicle columns before an assault.

  Unlike direct-fire skirmishers, Thanatos thrives behind the frontlines — protected by tanks or terrain — where it can rain destruction with impunity. Its slow speed and minimal armor make it vulnerable to fast flanks or direct retaliation, so smart positioning and screen units are key.

  **Best used for:** Sieging static defenses, supporting frontal pushes, denying choke points  
  **Avoid:** Operating unsupported, direct line-of-sight engagements, ambushes by fast units
