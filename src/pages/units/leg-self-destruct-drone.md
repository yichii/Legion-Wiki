description: |
  **The Martyr** is a compact, high-speed suicide drone engineered for disruption through explosive sacrifice. Once within range, it detonates with a volatile charge designed to cripple tightly grouped units or punch holes in static defenses. It offers no ranged attack â€” its entire purpose is to close in and explode.

  While fragile, its low cost and speed make it a potent tool when used in numbers or from unexpected angles. Whether overwhelming static defenses or targeting exposed constructors, the Martyr thrives on surprise and swarm tactics.

  **Best used for:** Disabling static defenses, punishing unit clusters, swarm assaults  
  **Avoid:** Sending solo into anti-air or before a clear path is opened
