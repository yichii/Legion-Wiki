description: |
  **The Phalanx** is a front-line riot bot engineered to control chokepoints and hold the line under pressure. Equipped with a heavy blast cannon and reinforced by a built-in energy shield, it excels at repelling swarm attacks, absorbing early volleys, and disrupting tightly-packed enemy formations.

  Though slower than most frontline bots, its durability and area denial make it an ideal anchor in mixed compositions. When backed by artillery or ranged fire support, the Phalanx becomes a wall that is difficult to break â€” but vulnerable if isolated or outmaneuvered.

  **Best used for:** Holding choke points, protecting vulnerable units, stopping light rushes  
  **Avoid:** Being flanked, outranged by siege units, or left unsupported in open terrain
