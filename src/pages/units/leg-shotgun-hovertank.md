description: |
  **The Cardea** is a powerful close-range hover tank designed to punish anything that dares get too close. Armed with a devastating medium shotgun, it delivers massive burst damage at short range, making it deadly against swarms, light armor, and overextended enemies.

  With high health but sluggish speed, the Cardea functions best as a brawler in chokepoints, ambush zones, or as a meat shield during frontal pushes. However, its limited range and hover pathing mean it must be carefully positioned to avoid getting kited or focused down before closing the gap.

  **Best used for:** Ambushes, frontline tanking, short-range burst damage  
  **Avoid:** Long-range duels, open terrain without cover or support
