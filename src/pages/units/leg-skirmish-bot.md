description: |
  **The Goblin** is a fast, low-cost skirmish bot designed to harass, scout, and chip away at enemy forces. Armed with a rapid-fire machine gun and boasting high mobility, it excels at hit-and-run tactics and early map control.

  While fragile on its own, Goblins become lethal in packs â€” swarming slow targets, pressuring expansions, or delaying tech paths. Their excellent vision also makes them great at spotting ambushes or guiding artillery.

  **Best used for:** Early map control, raiding constructors, light harassment  
  **Avoid:** Heavy turrets, AoE, or direct 1v1s with tanky units
