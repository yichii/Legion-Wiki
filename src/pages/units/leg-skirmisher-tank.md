description: |
  **The Helios** is a fast skirmisher tank equipped with a focused heat ray, ideal for dancing at mid-range and wearing down enemy forces from a safe distance. Its damage output ramps up under sustained fire, rewarding smart positioning and target selection.

  While not durable enough for frontline brawls, the Helios shines when used to kite heavier units, support assault pushes, or pick off light targets. Its mobility allows it to reposition quickly, making it difficult to pin down.

  **Best used for:** Mid-range harassment, support fire, kiting slow units  
  **Avoid:** Close-range duels, massed high-DPS fire
