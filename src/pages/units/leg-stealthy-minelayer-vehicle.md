description: |
  **The Sapper** is a stealth-enabled minelayer and minesweeper vehicle designed to control territory and disrupt enemy movement. It excels at creating hidden minefields to delay pushes, punish pathing, and defend vulnerable flanks or expansions.

  While its Seismic Charge is weak in direct combat, its true strength lies in its ability to set traps and detect or clear enemy mines. Use it preemptively to control choke points or defensively to slow down advancing forces.

  **Best used for:** Stealth minefields, area denial, anti-mine utility  
  **Avoid:** Frontline roles, direct engagements â€” it's not a fighter
