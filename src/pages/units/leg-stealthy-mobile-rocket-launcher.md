description: |
  **The Boreas** is a stealth-enabled, long-range rocket launcher designed to devastate enemy positions without ever revealing its location. Equipped with a high-trajectory starburst rocket system, it delivers powerful indirect fire from extreme distances, striking targets before they can respond.

  Thanks to its stealth capabilities, the Boreas excels at hit-and-run bombardments, ambushing static defenses, and harassing key infrastructure â€” all while remaining off enemy radar. It thrives when used in combination with forward scouts or radar units.

  **Best used for:** Stealthy fire support, softening defenses, long-range harassment  
  **Avoid:** Close-range encounters, AoE retaliation, operating without vision support
