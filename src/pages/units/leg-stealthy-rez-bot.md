description: |
  **The Zagreus** is a stealth resurrection bot designed to covertly revive fallen units and reclaim battlefield scrap. While completely unarmed, it plays a crucial support role by turning destroyed units into a hidden economy advantage — especially in drawn-out skirmishes or attritional battles.

  Its high speed and stealth capabilities allow it to sneak behind lines, recover valuable units, or salvage wrecks in contested zones. Protected properly, a few Zagreus bots can tilt the balance of attrition heavily in Legion’s favor.

  **Best used for:** Stealth revives, wreckage economy, mid-fight reanimation  
  **Avoid:** Any combat exposure — keep it hidden and protected
