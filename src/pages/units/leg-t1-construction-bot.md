description: |
  **The Construction Bot** is Legion’s most basic and cost-efficient builder unit. It can construct all Tier 1 structures and is critical for early economic growth, base expansion, and map control. Although slow and unarmed, it provides passive utility by generating a small amount of energy and expanding the player's storage capacity by +50 for both metal and energy.

  Use multiple bots to accelerate build times and scale faster. When expanding to new resource points or frontline bases, always **escort your constructors** to prevent ambushes — losing them can cripple momentum. Keep them alive, and your economy will thank you.

  **Best used for:** Early structure spam, eco scaling, passive energy trickle  
  **Avoid:** Sending unprotected into contested areas — they’re vulnerable
