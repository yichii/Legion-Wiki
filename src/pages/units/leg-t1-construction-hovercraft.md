description: |
  **The Construction Hovercraft** is Legion’s versatile amphibious builder, capable of navigating both land and shallow seas with ease. Designed for flexible base expansion, it plays a vital role in establishing naval facilities, forward defenses, or reclaiming contested zones near water.

  While unarmed, its moderate speed and hover mobility let it access locations other builders can't — including island starts and coastal flanks. Like other constructors, it contributes to energy trickle and modest storage increases. Protect it well; its loss during early naval expansion can be devastating.

  **Best used for:** Amphibious base building, flexible expansion, coastal and island starts  
  **Avoid:** Lone travel into hostile territory — escort with combat units
