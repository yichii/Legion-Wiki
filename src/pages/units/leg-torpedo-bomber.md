description: |
  **The Aesacus** is a dedicated torpedo bomber designed to hunt sea-based threats with precision and speed. Armed with dual homing torpedoes, it excels at striking ships, submarines, and naval structures from above â€” delivering pinpoint damage before retreating to safety.

  Its impressive airspeed and wide sight range make it ideal for patrol runs and opportunistic strikes along coastlines and deep water. However, it is poorly suited for land targets and vulnerable to both air and anti-air fire, so deploy with awareness and escort.

  **Best used for:** Sinking ships, patrolling naval zones, hit-and-run sea strikes  
  **Avoid:** Ground targets, heavy AA coverage, operating without vision or support
