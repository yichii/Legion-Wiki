description: |
  **The Anti-Nuke Launcher** is a critical defensive structure that intercepts incoming ICBMs and nuclear artillery shells. Once stockpiled with anti-nuke missiles, it automatically protects nearby areas within its large coverage radius.

  Though it does not attack conventional units, it plays a vital role in late-game base defense, especially against players investing in long-range nuclear capabilities.

  **Best used for:** Blocking nukes, base defense  
  **Avoid:** Leaving it empty or exposed without cover
