description: |
  **The Eviscerator** is a powerful long-range pop-up artillery structure that fires cluster plasma rounds. Once engaged, it saturates a large area with multiple explosive shells, making it deadly against groups of slow-moving enemies or entrenched positions.

  It can switch between direct and high-trajectory fire modes, and its effectiveness is amplified by smart trajectory calculations that improve its consistency over distance.

  **Best used for:** Shelling enemy lines, area denial, breaking entrenched positions  
  **Avoid:** Fast skirmishers, VTOLs, and direct assault due to pop-up delay
