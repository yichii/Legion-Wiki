description: |
  **The Advanced Energy Converter** is a tier-2 structure that passively transforms surplus energy into metal at a moderate efficiency rate. It serves as a key infrastructure upgrade in mid-to-late-game economies, allowing players to capitalize on high energy income.

  While it doesn't generate metal by itself, its conversion capabilities scale well with fusion reactors or other energy sources. Protect it from raids, as its destruction can severely impact economic throughput.

  **Best used for:** Scaling metal income, stabilizing resource balance  
  **Avoid:** Building without energy surplus, exposing to frontline damage
