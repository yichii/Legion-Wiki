  **The Hardened Energy Storage** is a tier-2 infrastructure building designed to significantly expand your energy buffer. With a massive 40,000 capacity, it enables your economy to absorb power surges and outages, ensuring continuous unit production and shield uptime.

  Though it does not generate energy itself, itâ€™s crucial for stabilizing high-energy operations and maximizing efficiency from power-generating structures. Vulnerable to chain explosions, so spacing and protection are advised.

  **Best used for:** Supporting fusion or conversion economies, shielding large energy reserves  
  **Avoid:** Clustering too many together, relying on it for energy production
