description: |
  **The Advanced Solar Collector** is a compact and cost-efficient energy producer for midgame bases. Generating a reliable 100 energy per second, it provides a clean, self-sustaining power source without upkeep.

  While vulnerable to concentrated attacks and offering modest health, its small footprint and affordability make it ideal for safe expansion or supplementing high-consumption operations.

  **Best used for:** Stable midgame energy production  
  **Avoid:** Building in exposed areas or clustering too many in blast zones
