description: |
  **The Advanced Fusion Reactor** is a high-output energy structure crucial for powering late-game bases and production lines. Generating an impressive 3300 energy per second, it provides the backbone for energy-hungry strategies and superunit production.

  While well-armored for its class, its large explosion radius makes it a risky placement near vital assets. Smart players isolate or shield it to avoid catastrophic chain reactions.

  **Best used for:** Late-game energy production, supporting experimental units  
  **Avoid:** Clustering with other structures, front-line placement
