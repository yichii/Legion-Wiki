description: |
  **The Tiresias** is a tier-2 mobile support bot designed to obscure friendly movements with powerful radar jamming. Once activated, it emits a stealth field that disrupts enemy radar detection in a wide radius, keeping allied units hidden during maneuvers and staging.

  While unarmed and fragile, its low energy cost and constant cloak field make it an excellent companion for stealth-based strategies or forward positioning. It can be toggled off and on as needed to conserve energy or avoid detection.

  **Best used for:** Concealing armies, protecting stealth operations, radar denial  
  **Avoid:** Lone travel through contested zones, direct combat, EMP or splash damage
