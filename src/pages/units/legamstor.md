description: |
  **The Hardened Metal Storage** greatly increases your metal capacity, allowing commanders to sustain production and avoid overflow in high-income scenarios. While it does not generate or reclaim metal, itâ€™s vital for maximizing efficiency during late-game eco spikes.

  Best placed in protected areas, as its large health pool makes it durable but still vulnerable to concentrated attacks or chain explosions.

  **Best used for:** Expanding metal storage capacity, stabilizing economic surpluses  
  **Avoid:** Frontline placement, relying on it for metal generation
