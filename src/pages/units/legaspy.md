description: |
  **The Eidolon** is a tier-2 stealth reconnaissance bot specialized in cloaked forward expansion and passive intelligence gathering. With radar stealth, high movement speed, and low energy cloaking capabilities, it excels at infiltrating enemy lines unseen and establishing hidden infrastructure.

  While lightly armored and unarmed, the Eidolon's true strength lies in its ability to build while cloaked â€” perfect for forward radar, mines, or advanced structures behind enemy territory. Its low cost and minimal radar signature make it ideal for scouting and sabotage setups.

  **Best used for:** Stealth scouting, hidden base building, deepline intel  
  **Avoid:** Any direct confrontation, Intrusion Countermeasure System
