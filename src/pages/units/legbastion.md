description: |
  **The Bastion** is a heavy-tier defensive laser platform equipped with a sweeping beam weapon capable of sustained area denial. Designed for high durability and energy efficiency, it activates automatically upon construction and has a massive line-of-sight, enabling it to control large zones on its own.

  Though costly, it excels at punishing concentrated assaults and slow-pushing enemies. However, it lacks anti-air capabilities and should be complemented by dedicated AA defenses.

  Bastion also features a **"turtle shell" mode**, toggled via an ON/OFF button, which transforms it into a fortified T3 wall. While in this mode, its durability increases by **300%**, making it exceptionally resistant to artillery and nuclear bombardment. This defensive stance is especially useful when under heavy long-range fire.

  **Best used for:** Frontline anchoring, punishing swarm pushes, energy-efficient defense  
  **Avoid:** Air attacks, EMP, and long-range artillery duels
