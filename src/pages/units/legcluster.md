description: "**The Amputator** unleashes cluster munitions that devastate wide areas, ideal for punishing slow-moving or massed enemy ground units. With both direct and high-arc trajectories, it adapts well to varied terrain and unit density.\n\nDespite its cost, the sheer impact and area denial potential make it a centerpiece in entrenched defenses.\n\n**Best used for:** Long-range bombardment, anti-clump damage  \n**Avoid:** Fast units closing the gap, unsupported forward placement"
