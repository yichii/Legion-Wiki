description: "**The Euryale** is designed to detect and eliminate submerged threats with homing torpedoes. Its sonar capabilities allow it to scan beneath the surface, making it a vital part of any naval defensive line.\n\nThough it lacks surface firepower, its strength lies in denying enemy underwater movement and forcing submarines to retreat or engage cautiously.\n\n**Best used for:** Anti-submarine defense, guarding naval chokepoints  \n**Avoid:** Surface combat, unsupported placement in mixed-threat areas"
