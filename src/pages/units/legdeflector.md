description: |
  **The Deflector** is a powerful defensive structure equipped with a plasma repulsor field that blocks incoming projectiles. Rather than dealing direct damage, it excels at protecting valuable infrastructure or clustered units by intercepting enemy fire.

  Its high energy cost and large footprint are offset by its strategic impact, especially in siege scenarios or chokepoints.

  **Best used for:** Shielding forward bases, absorbing artillery fire  
  **Avoid:** EMP weapons, focused fire, or overwhelming spam
