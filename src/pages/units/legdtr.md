description: "**The Dragon's Jaw** is a deceptive defense structure built to draw enemy fire and shield more valuable targets. Mimicking high-priority threats, it misleads opponents and absorbs damage that would otherwise cripple core assets.

  Due to its stealth capabilities and reduced damage intake, it serves well as a frontline misdirection tool. However, its actual firepower and utility are limited, so it should always be paired with real threats.

  **Best used for:** Baiting enemy fire, shielding key units or defenses  
  **Avoid:** Solo engagements, relying on it for actual damage output"
