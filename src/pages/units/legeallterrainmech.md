description: |
  **The Myrmidon** is a tier-3 experimental mech designed to dominate from long range with flexible artillery and drone-assisted firepower. Armed with twin cluster plasma cannons, a smart targeting system, drone control matrix, and an advanced anti-air missile launcher, it excels in both siege and multi-role support.

  Capable of spawning autonomous heatray drones and launching plasma barrages in direct or high-trajectory modes, the Myrmidon can pressure entrenched positions while fending off air threats. Its rugged design and battlefield utility make it a powerful force multiplier when properly supported.

  **Best used for:** Long-range bombardment, drone harassment, defensive anchoring  
  **Avoid:** Close-range swarms, isolation without support, concentrated aerial assault
