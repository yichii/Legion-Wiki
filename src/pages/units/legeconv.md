  **The Energy Converter** is a basic structure that transforms surplus energy into a trickle of metal, providing essential economic flexibility during early- and mid-game phases.

  Though fragile and not highly efficient, it shines in maps with energy abundance or in stalled metal economies. Protect it well, as even light fire can destroy it due to its low durability.

  **Best used for:** Using excess energy, early-game eco stabilization  
  **Avoid:** Relying on it as a sole metal income source, placing in exposed areas
