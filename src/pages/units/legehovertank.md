description: |
  **The Charybdis** is a tier-3 hover assault tank designed for rapid, terrain-agnostic engagements. Equipped with a wide-beam heatray for surface targets, twin parabolic rocket pods for arcing bombardment, and a depthcharge launcher for underwater threats, it excels in amphibious frontline roles.

  Its mobility over land and shallow water, combined with burst fire capability and sonar coverage, make it a versatile pick for shoreline assaults and mixed-terrain skirmishes. While not as durable as some land-based T3s, its speed and weapon flexibility allow it to hit hard and reposition quickly.

  **Best used for:** Hit-and-run hover raids, amphibious strikes, anti-sub harassment  
  **Avoid:** Heavy concentrated fire, prolonged duels against high-armor land walkers
