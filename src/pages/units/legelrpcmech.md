description: |
  **The Astraeus** is a tier-3 experimental long-range artillery walker designed for saturating massive areas with heavy plasma clusters. Its primary weapon — the *Shocker* — is a long-range g2g (ground-to-ground) cannon that fires cluster shells capable of obliterating stationary defenses or large enemy formations.

  Though slow and vulnerable to fast skirmishers, the unit's extreme range (3100) allows it to strike deep into enemy territory with impunity when properly screened. It’s a siege unit first and foremost, thriving when paired with scouts and frontliners that can spot for it or absorb return fire.

  **Best used for:** Long-range sieging, defense busting, denying static positions  
  **Avoid:** Close-range ambushes, fast raiders, unsupported pushes
