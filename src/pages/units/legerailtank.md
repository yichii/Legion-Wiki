description: |
  **Daedalus** is a tier-3 heavy siege platform armed exclusively with triple-linked **Siege Rail Accelerators**. These hypervelocity railguns punch through armor and fortifications with devastating accuracy, functioning as long-range energy slugs that can penetrate lined-up targets.  

  Unlike most heavy units, Daedalus features an **advanced smart targeting system**: within each burst, it can automatically retarget its railgun shots to avoid overkill. This ensures maximum damage efficiency, preventing wasted fire on enemies already crippled or destroyed in the opening hits.  

  **Best used for:** Sniping high-value units, breaking fortified positions, precision long-range fire support  
  **Avoid:** Being caught in close-quarters brawls, extended artillery duels without cover, energy starvation
