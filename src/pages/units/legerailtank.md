description: |
  **The Daedalus** is a tier-3 heavy railgun platform designed for long-range siege and direct firepower dominance. Its main cannon, the *Siege Rail Accelerator*, deals devastating armor-piercing shots ideal for shredding high-HP targets and breaking static defenses.

  In addition to its primary weapon, it features quad-mounted machine guns for close-range suppression and anti-light screening. With solid durability and surprising mobility for its size, it can push through defended zones and serve as the backbone of a late-game armored column.

  **Best used for:** Long-range sieging, area denial, supporting pushes through entrenched lines  
  **Avoid:** Flank attacks, massed air without AA support, being stunned mid-frontline
