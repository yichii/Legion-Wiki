description: |
  **The Praetorian** is a tier-3 experimental unit that brings overwhelming close- to mid-range firepower to the battlefield. Equipped with a dual heavy shotgun, long-range cluster plasma cannon, multi-rocket system, and a dedicated anti-air minigun, it can engage any target category effectively â€” air or ground.

  Its durable frame and versatile loadout make it ideal for spearheading assaults, obliterating fortifications, or holding key chokepoints. However, its relatively short weapon ranges and large frame require support from longer-range units or air coverage to reach full potential.

  **Best used for:** Close-quarters obliteration, heavy frontline pressure, area saturation  
  **Avoid:** Extended open-range duels without support, being kited by faster skirmishers
