  **The Energy Storage** provides a crucial buffer for excess energy, helping maintain output during bursts of demand or loss of supply.

  Though modest in cost and durability, it’s a vital addition to any growing economy—especially when paired with structures like Fusion Reactors or Geothermals.

  **Best used for:** Expanding energy reserve capacity, buffering spikes in energy consumption  
  **Avoid:** Clustering with other critical infrastructure to reduce splash damage risks
