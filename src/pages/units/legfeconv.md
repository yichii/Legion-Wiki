description: |
  The **Naval Energy Converter** turns excess energy into metal at a conversion rate of 70:1. It's a floating counterpart to the standard converter and is best deployed when you're capped on energy and need more metal income.

  Itâ€™s fragile and water-bound, so place it in protected locations or behind naval defenses.

  **Best used for:** Turning surplus energy into metal on water maps  
  **Avoid:** Building without enough energy income or leaving it exposed
