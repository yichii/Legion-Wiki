description: |
  **The Floating Hive** is a mobile drone carrier designed for naval support operations. It deploys autonomous drones over time, each costing 15 metal and 500 energy to produce. The drones can dock back to the Hive for healing and redeployment.

  With a long control radius and smart docking behavior, the Floating Hive excels at zone control over water, especially when placed behind more durable units or structures.

  **Best used for:** Sustained harassment, area denial, naval line support  
  **Avoid:** Heavy burst damage or concentrated airstrikes
