description: |
  **The Pluto** is a heavy anti-air defense structure equipped with a rapid-firing gatling gun specialized for taking down aircraft at range.

  It excels at shredding air units with sustained fire, especially clustered or slower targets like bombers. However, it cannot target ground units and must be protected from ground assaults.

  **Best used for:** Mid-to-late game air denial, protecting key infrastructure from air raids  
  **Avoid:** Ground threats, poor placement that exposes it to artillery
