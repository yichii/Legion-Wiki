description: |
  The **Gelasma** provides rapid-fire anti-air defense for naval zones and shallow waters. With a high burst rate and broad spray angle, it excels at shredding light to medium air units.

  This turret is relatively fragile and has limited range, making it best suited for front-line deterrence or protecting key positions like shipyards or sea-based expansions.

  **Best used for:** Defending against early air raids  
  **Avoid:** Direct fire from land-based artillery or ships
