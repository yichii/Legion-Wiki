  **Fortification Wall** is a durable stationary wall designed to obstruct unit movement and absorb fire. It offers high crush resistance, making it excellent for delaying or diverting enemy forces.

  Though it has no attack capabilities, its robust structure and low metal cost make it ideal for chokepoints, base shielding, or strategic path control.

  **Best used for:** Terrain control, line-of-sight blocking, and absorbing damage  
  **Avoid:** Air units, artillery, or mobile assaults without backup
