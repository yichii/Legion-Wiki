  **The Fusion Reactor** is a tier-2 power plant that delivers a massive and steady energy supply. With built-in storage and high output, it's essential for late-game operations and sustaining power-heavy structures or armies.

  Despite its efficiency, the fusion reactor is a high-value targetâ€”its explosive destruction can cripple your economy or damage nearby infrastructure. Always build with spacing and shields in mind.

  **Best used for:** Powering late-game bases, sustaining energy-hungry armies, economic expansion  
  **Avoid:** Overexposing without protection, clustering with other vital structures
