description: |
  **The Geothermal Powerplant** is a cost-effective energy generator that must be placed on geothermal vents. Offering reliable output and a modest storage buffer, itâ€™s a solid Tier-1+ energy source for expanding bases.

  Geothermals are less volatile than fusion plants but still vulnerable to focused assaults due to predictable placement. Use them to complement solar or fusion generation in mid-game setups.

  **Best used for:** Efficient energy generation on geothermal spots, powering economy expansions  
  **Avoid:** Overcommitting on clustered vent locations without defenses
