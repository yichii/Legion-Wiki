description: |
  **The Hive** is an experimental autonomous drone carrier that acts as a long-range defense system. Instead of firing traditional projectiles, it launches and maintains a swarm of attack drones, overwhelming enemies through attrition and coordinated assaults.

  Its effectiveness scales with uptimeâ€”more drones mean more sustained fire. Vulnerable to burst damage or AoE that can wipe out its drones. Best placed behind frontlines where it can operate without direct fire.

  **Best used for:** Sustained support fire, zone control with autonomous drones  
  **Avoid:** Direct damage, EMP or AoE-heavy assaults
