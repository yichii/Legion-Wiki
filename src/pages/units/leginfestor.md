description: |
  **The Infestor** is a tier-2 stealth-capable support bot that doubles as a mobile constructor and short-range brawler. Equipped with a light heatray for close-quarters defense and the ability to reclaim, assist, and build in forward zones, itâ€™s well-suited for behind-the-lines expansion or harassment.

  Its cloaked movement and decent durability allow it to infiltrate enemy areas, set up surprise defenses or reclaim operations, and skirmish with vulnerable units. Although not a frontline fighter, the Infestor can pack a punch in tight spaces when supported.

  **Best used for:** Stealth building, surprise fortification, reclaim and disrupt plays  
  **Avoid:** Heavy direct fire, detection fields, prolonged engagements without backup
