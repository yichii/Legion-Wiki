description: |
  **The Javelin** is a tier-3 heavy assault bot equipped with dual weapon systems: rapid-fire machine guns for surface combat and a rotary cannon for anti-air. It is designed to handle a wide range of threats while remaining highly mobile for its class.

  With respectable speed and durability, Legjav can function as both a frontline bruiser and a mobile air denial platform. Its effectiveness is amplified when supported by repair units or shielded allies. While not the tankiest T3 unit, its versatility makes it a powerful addition to late-game compositions.

  **Best used for:** Multi-role frontline pushes, heavy skirmishing, area control  
  **Avoid:** Isolated engagements without support, getting swarmed by air or artillery
