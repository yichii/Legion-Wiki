description: |
  **The Juno** is a strategic pulse emitter that disables enemy mines, radar, and jammer systems within a massive radius. It fires electromagnetic payloads that are particularly effective at clearing hidden threats and disrupting sensor networks across the battlefield.

  While it deals minimal damage, its value lies in tactical control and utility. Stockpile-based and costly per shot, it should be used deliberately and with timing.

  **Best used for:** Disabling enemy minefields, radar arrays, or disrupting stealth setups  
  **Avoid:** Direct engagements or frequent manual fire without careful planning
