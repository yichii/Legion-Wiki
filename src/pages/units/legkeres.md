description: |
  **The Keres** is a tier-3 armored riot tank, built for sustained pressure and frontline resilience. Its dual-weapon system features a heavy riot cannon for explosive area damage and twin rotary cannons for constant suppressive fire, making it especially lethal against clustered or lightly armored enemies.

  With a large health pool and solid mobility for its weight class, the Legkeres is ideal for soaking damage and pushing through contested areas. Though not long-ranged, it dominates close-to-mid range duels and can clear chokepoints with ease.

  **Best used for:** Frontline breaching, close-quarters suppression, absorbing damage  
  **Avoid:** Long-range duels, swarm units with high DPS, heavy artillery zones
