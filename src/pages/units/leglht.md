description: |
  **The Pharos** is a stationary defense turret armed with a light heat ray, designed to deter early-game ground assaults with consistent mid-range firepower. Though it lacks the durability or damage output of heavier emplacements, its low cost and fast build time make it an efficient frontline deterrent.

  Ideal for covering choke points or supplementing other defenses, the Pharos excels at thinning out lighter enemy units before they can close the gap. However, it struggles against air threats or concentrated fire, so pairing it with AA or heavier turrets is advised.

  **Best used for:** Early defense, choke point coverage, delaying enemy advances  
  **Avoid:** Air attacks, heavy siege units, unsupported deployment
