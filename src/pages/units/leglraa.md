description: |
  **The Xyston** is a long-range anti-air battery designed to deny large swaths of airspace to enemy gunships and bombers. Equipped with advanced railgun and missile systems, it is capable of striking aircraft from extreme distances.

  Its activation upon construction and wide targeting arc allow it to react quickly to threats. However, like many specialized defenses, it offers no utility against ground units and must be paired with complementary support.

  **Best used for:** Defending against massed air raids and high-value aerial targets  
  **Avoid:** Ground assaults, especially with direct-fire units
