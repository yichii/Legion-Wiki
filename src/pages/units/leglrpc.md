description: |
  **The Olympus** is a long-range artillery installation capable of saturating distant targets with cluster plasma shells. Its area control potential makes it ideal for pressuring enemy bases or discouraging static defenses.

  It consumes a significant amount of energy per shot and has a long reload time, making energy infrastructure essential. Vulnerable to direct assaults or fast units that close the distance.

  **Best used for:** Long-range bombardment, breaking stalemates, siege support  
  **Avoid:** Rushes, flanking, or energy shortages
