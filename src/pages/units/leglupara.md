description: |
  **The Lupara** is a heavy static anti-air flak emplacement with a wide blast radius and high-altitude reach. It is particularly effective against clustered air units, punishing massed gunship or bomber assaults with brutal area coverage.

  While less accurate against fast, single targets, it provides exceptional area denial and complements point-defense AA systems. Position it near vital structures or in choke points for maximum effect.

  **Best used for:** High-volume air suppression, area denial against bombers  
  **Avoid:** Low-flying single targets, ground units
