  **The Metal Extractor** is the Legion's basic resource harvester for metal. It must be placed on metal patches and provides steady, low-cost income. It can be toggled off to avoid drawing upkeep during low-power states.

  Fragile and vital, these structures should be spread out and protected, especially in early and mid-game phases. Upgrade paths or control of additional patches are essential for scaling metal income.

  **Best used for:** Economical early-game expansion, consistent passive income  
  **Avoid:** Leaving unprotected, powering too many off-grid
