description: |
  **The Overcharged Metal Extractor** greatly increases metal income over standard extractors but comes with a significant energy upkeep. Best placed on high-yield deposits, this structure enables mid-to-late game production scaling.

  Due to its higher cost and vulnerability, it should be placed in well-defended or distant locations with strategic importance. Toggle functionality allows fine energy control in grid-constrained situations.

  **Best used for:** High-efficiency resource generation, key territory consolidation  
  **Avoid:** Building too early, leaving exposed to raids
