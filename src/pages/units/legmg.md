description: "**The Cacophony** shreds light armor and air units alike with a continuous stream of high-velocity kinetic rounds. Its burst damage makes it a strong deterrent to fast skirmishers and flybys.\n\nWhile devastating up close, its effectiveness falls off at range, and it may struggle to handle high-HP targets alone.\n\n**Best used for:** Close-range AA and anti-light harassment  \n**Avoid:** Long-range engagements, solo use against heavy armor"
