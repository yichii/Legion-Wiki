description: |
  The **Light Mine** is a low-cost, low-damage explosive trap designed for early deterrence. Cloaked by default and with minimal energy upkeep, itâ€™s ideal for laying down ambushes or delaying enemy advances. While it deals no damage directly, it can trigger chain reactions or support defensive strategies by forcing enemy units to detour or expose themselves.

  **Best used for:** Early-game area denial, delaying scouts  
  **Avoid:** Expecting significant damage output or durability
