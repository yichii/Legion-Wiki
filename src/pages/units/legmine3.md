description: |
  **Heavy Mine** is a heavy-duty cloaked explosive mine designed for maximum impact against enemy units. With a high energy and metal cost, it trades cost efficiency for raw detonation power, ideal for critical chokepoints or base perimeters.

  Automatically detonates on proximity and works best when placed in high-traffic enemy routes. Invisible until triggered, making it excellent for ambushes.

  **Best used for:** Delaying or damaging high-value targets  
  **Avoid:** Detection systems and mass-unit sweeps
