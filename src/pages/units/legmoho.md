  **The Advanced Metal Extractor** is a Tier-2 upgrade over basic metal extractors, offering significantly higher yield. It demands a steady energy supply to sustain its enhanced operation but is well worth the investment in metal-rich zones.

  Its increased durability and larger footprint make it more resilient, but also a more attractive target. Strategic positioning and defenses are crucial to maximize uptime.

  **Best used for:** Maximizing metal income in contested or rich areas  
  **Avoid:** Running without sufficient energy or placing in exposed frontlines
