  **The Metal Storage** increases your team's metal capacity by 3000. While it doesn’t generate or spend resources, it’s essential when your economy is producing more metal than you can use.

  Building additional storages prevents overflow and ensures your economy keeps running efficiently. Place them safely in your base, as they are relatively fragile compared to their value.

  **Best used for:** Buffering excess metal production  
  **Avoid:** Relying on them to improve income—this isn’t a generator
