description: |
  **The Perdition** is a long-range tactical artillery structure that launches devastating napalm shells. These shells ignite wide areas, inflicting massive burn damage over time and denying territory to enemy forces.

  With high area-of-effect and the ability to stockpile shots, it excels at softening up enemy defenses, denying choke points, and breaking large assaults before they begin.

  **Best used for:** Area denial, siege, heavy attrition fire  
  **Avoid:** Fast raids, direct confrontation without support
