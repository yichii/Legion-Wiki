description: |
  **The Chimera** is a heavily fortified turret that combines a riot blast cannon with dual miniguns, delivering relentless suppression against advancing ground forces.

  Thanks to its pop-up mechanism and excellent durability, it performs well when embedded in defensive lines or covering choke points. However, it lacks anti-air capability and is vulnerable to long-range bombardment.

  **Best used for:** Frontline suppression, defending narrow terrain, holding ground against swarms  
  **Avoid:** Long-range artillery, air strikes
