description: |
  The **Rampart** is a high-tech multipurpose geothermal powerplant. It generates energy, jams enemy radar, detects units over a wide range, and acts as both an **anti-nuke interceptor** and **drone carrier**. It automatically stockpiles interceptors and deploys heavy drones for battlefield support.

  This makes it a strategic cornerstone in late-game defense and area denial.

  **Best used for:** Protecting your base from nukes, deploying support drones, and radar jamming  
  **Avoid:** Relying on it alone—it’s powerful but requires support and resource investment
