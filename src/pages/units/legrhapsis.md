description: "**The Rhapsis** saturates the skies with a rapid salvo of guided AA munitions, ideal for overwhelming light and fast-moving aircraft. Its wide coverage and tracking make it a powerful counter to swarm air tactics.\n\nThough it fires in bursts, each individual missile is relatively weak â€” so it's best used to chip away at enemy air formations.\n\n**Best used for:** Anti-swarm AA, base air denial  \n**Avoid:** Ground threats, isolated use without radar support"
