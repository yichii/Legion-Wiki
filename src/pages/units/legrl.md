description: "**The Bramble** is a static anti-air missile turret designed to swat down incoming aircraft with precision-guided missiles. Its tracking capabilities and long range make it a reliable solution against enemy air harassment.\n\nWhile ineffective against ground targets, it excels when placed near critical structures or unit clusters that need air cover. Best used in tandem with radar for early detection and area denial.\n\n**Best used for:** Anti-air perimeter defense, protecting expansions and factories  \n**Avoid:** Ground combat, overreliance without radar coverage"
