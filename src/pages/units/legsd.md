description: |
  **The Ichnaea** is a specialized utility structure designed to detect cloaked or stealthy ground units within a large radius. Its passive seismic sensing makes it invaluable for early warning and counter-stealth strategies.

  This building has no offensive capabilities but plays a critical role in securing your territory from infiltration or ambushes.

  **Best used for:** Revealing cloaked units, securing base perimeter  
  **Avoid:** Front-line use without support, since it cannot defend itself
