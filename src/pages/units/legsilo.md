description: |
  **The Silo** is a long-range strategic missile launcher capable of devastating entire areas with a single thermonuclear warhead. Once stockpiled, its missiles can be manually targeted across nearly the entire map, obliterating key enemy structures, armies, or strongholds.

  While immensely powerful, it requires a substantial investment in energy and metal to produce and fire. Vulnerable to raids and precision strikes â€” protect it accordingly.

  **Best used for:** Strategic strikes, psychological pressure, late-game win conditions  
  **Avoid:** Enemy scouts spotting it early, insufficient energy economy, and leaving it undefended
