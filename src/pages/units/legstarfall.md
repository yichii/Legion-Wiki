description: |
  **The Starfall** is a devastating experimental artillery platform capable of unleashing a massive high-trajectory barrage over extreme distances. Firing dozens of plasma shells in rapid succession, it saturates target zones with explosive force.

  With a reload cycle that rivals nuclear artillery and an extreme energy requirement, it demands infrastructure and protectionâ€”but few structures in the game rival its impact once it fires.

  **Best used for:** Long-range siege, overwhelming fortified positions, psychological warfare  
  **Avoid:** Being caught unprotected or under sustained assault during reload cycles
