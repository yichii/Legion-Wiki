description: |
  The **Tidal Generator** produces energy based on the map’s tidal strength. It's a water-only structure and is especially cost-effective on maps with strong tides.

  It’s cheap, compact, and doesn’t require sunlight or wind, but performance varies depending on map settings.

  **Best used for:** Steady, early-game water-based energy  
  **Avoid:** Building on maps with low tidal strength
