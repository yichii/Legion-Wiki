It features sonar detection and medium-range underwater firepower, making it ideal for controlling shallows and protecting coastal approaches.\n\nIts effectiveness is limited to aquatic threats, so pairing it with other coastal defenses ensures full coverage.\n\n**Best used for:** Shallow-water defense, anti-sub coverage  \n**Avoid:** Surface-only threats, isolated placement without support"
