  The **Naval Energy Storage** is a submerged structure that stores large amounts of energy. Itâ€™s ideal for sea-based bases and protects your reserves from early land-based raids.

  While it doesn't generate energy, it offers high capacity and decent survivability.

  **Best used for:** Expanding energy reserves in sea-based builds  
  **Avoid:** Relying on it without energy generation nearby
