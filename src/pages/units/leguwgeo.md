description: |
  The **Underwater Geothermal Generator** taps into thermal vents beneath the sea, offering massive energy output for its cost.

  Itâ€™s a mid-tech structure best placed on underwater geothermal spots. While it offers high efficiency, its dependency on specific terrain makes placement limited.

  **Best used for:** Powering mid-to-late game sea bases  
  **Avoid:** Building in non-geothermal zones
