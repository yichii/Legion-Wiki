description: |
  The **Wind Turbine** passively produces energy based on wind strength, making it a cost-efficient alternative to solar collectors—especially on wind-heavy maps.

  It’s quick to build and pays for itself early, but beware of unreliable power on maps with low wind speeds.

  **Best used for:** Flexible early-game energy  
  **Avoid:** Relying on it alone for stable energy output
